### marinated tenderloin
Prepare 275 grams of tenderloin, cut into index finger-sized strips, sprinkle with 2 grams of salt and 0.5 grams of white pepper. Grab it with your hands. Add about 27 grams of water (prickly ash water is better) while grasping, rub the water into the meat manually, add shredded onion and ginger slices and marinate for 10 minutes.

### make the batter
准备80克中筋面粉，加入60克玉米淀粉、1克盐、10克糖、2克泡打粉、0.5克白胡椒粉，搅拌搅合；泡打粉的加入可以让面糊更蓬松和轻盈。加入面粉和淀粉等重量的140克水，搅拌到面粉变成面糊，里脊裹上面糊以后看不到肉色。
